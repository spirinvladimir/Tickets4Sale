## Description

This story is about opening-up the above functionality via a web site. For now the web site will only be used by employees of Tickets4Sale. So,
you donâ€™t have to worry about security.
The web site will be used to check the ticket status of a performance for a show. The inventory that is used by the web site is provided as a
separate CSV file, and is part of the web site. In other words the employee does not have to upload the inventory file. Also the query-date is used
internally as the date that the employee uses the web site. Hence, this will be "today".

## The UI consists of two main parts:

* Selecting the show date
* Showing a list of show performances with ticket
    * information
    * Title of show
    * Tickets left for the performance of the show on the show date
    * Tickets available for sale
    * Status of the ticket sale
    * NEW: Price of a ticket

The mock-up is purely for clarification. You have all the freedom for presenting this information the way you feel is best. Also don't forget about
validation feedback on incorrect input.
